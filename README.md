# ArduinoSocketTest
A light and a button that connect to a NodeJS server with SocketIO.

This was tested on an UNO with a W5100 ethernet shield, and I dont expect it to work with anything else. I removed support for any wifi
connectivity to supress errors.

This needs this hacked up library as of now: https://github.com/A-Team-IOT/Hacked-ScoketIO.
And is meant to work with this: https://github.com/A-Team-IOT/Server.
